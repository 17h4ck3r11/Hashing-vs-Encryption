                <p>Hashing is a one-way function that takes an input (message or data) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is usually a hash value or hash code. The primary purpose of hashing is to create a digital fingerprint or checksum of data. Hash functions are designed in such a way that even a small change in the input data will result in a significantly different hash output. This property is known as the "avalanche effect."</p>

                Key points about hashing:
                <ol>
                    <li>One-Way: Hash functions are designed to be irreversible, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input from the hash output.</li>
                    <li>Fixed Size: Hash functions always produce output of a fixed size, regardless of the size of the input.
                    <li>Deterministic: Given the same input, a hash function will always produce the same output.</li>
                    <li>Collision Resistance: Hash functions strive to avoid collisions, where two different inputs produce the same hash output.</li>
                    <li>Use Cases: Hashing is commonly used for data integrity verification (ensuring data hasn't been tampered with), password storage (storing hashed passwords instead of plain text), and creating digital signatures.</li>
                </ol><br>
                Common hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-3. It's important to note that older hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1 are no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities that have been discovered over time.

                    Encryption is a process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encrypted data) using an algorithm and a key. The primary purpose of encryption is to secure data by making it unreadable to unauthorized parties. To decrypt the data and retrieve the original plaintext, a decryption process is applied using the appropriate decryption key.

                Key points about encryption:
                <ol>    
                    <li>Two-Way: Unlike hashing, encryption is a reversible process. You can decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext if you have the correct decryption key.</li>
                    <li>Variable Size: Encrypted output can be of variable size, depending on the encryption algorithm used and the length of the input.</li>
                    <li>Key Dependency: Encryption relies on encryption keys for both encryption and decryption processes.</li>
                    <li>Confidentiality: Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the original information.</li>
                    <li>Use Cases: Encryption is used for securing data transmission (e.g., HTTPS for secure web communication), data storage (encrypting files or databases), and protecting sensitive information.</li>
                </ol><br>
                Common encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for symmetric encryption and RSA or ECC for asymmetric encryption.
